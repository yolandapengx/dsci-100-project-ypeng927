The first dataset includes information about a list of all unique players, including data about each player. The second dataset refers to a list of individual play sessions by each player, including data about the session. The data was collected through a MineCraft server set up by the research group through PLAICraft, where players' actions and information were recorded as they navigated through the world."

    "### Issues with the Data\n",
    "Some issues I see in the given data is that it is unclear how exactly the variables `original_start_time` and `original_end_time` are represented and what units they take on. I also believe that it would be helpful to include a variable representing the time between the start and end times of a session, in order to make it easier to find the summary statistics for the length of each session in addition to the start and end times. Additionally, the values of the `hashedEmail` variable are lengthy and not human-readable, which could potentially make it difficult to compare/relate the data from the sessions dataset with the players dataset."

    "The broad question I am looking to address is **which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.** The specific question I will address is: **Can `played_hours` and `Age` predict `experience` in the `players.csv` dataset?** The `players.csv` dataset already includes the necessary explanatory and predictive variables needed to answer the question. By plotting the `played_hours` and `Age` variables against each other and coloring the points by class, we may be able to predict which \"kind\" a player is based on how much they play, and thus we can figure out which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to have greater play times and thus contibute a larger amount of data. It may be necessary to convert the `experience` and `gender` variables to a categorial type rather than `<chr>`."
