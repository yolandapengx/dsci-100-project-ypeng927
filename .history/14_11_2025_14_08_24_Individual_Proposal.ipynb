The first dataset includes information about a list of all unique players, including data about each player. The second dataset refers to a list of individual play sessions by each player, including data about the session. The data was collected through a MineCraft server set up by the research group through PLAICraft, where players' actions and information were recorded as they navigated through the world."

    "### Issues with the Data\n",
    "Some issues I see in the given data is that it is unclear how exactly the variables `original_start_time` and `original_end_time` are represented and what units they take on. I also believe that it would be helpful to include a variable representing the time between the start and end times of a session, in order to make it easier to find the summary statistics for the length of each session in addition to the start and end times. Additionally, the values of the `hashedEmail` variable are lengthy and not human-readable, which could potentially make it difficult to compare/relate the data from the sessions dataset with the players dataset."

    "The broad question I am looking to address is **which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.** The specific question I will address is: **Can `experience` and `gender` predict `played_hours` in the `players.csv` dataset?** The `players.csv` dataset already includes the necessary explanatory and predictive variables needed to answer the question. By plotting the `experience` and `gender` variables as factors against the `played_hours`, we may be able to predict, with linear regression, the play time of certain \"kinds\" of players and thus the amount of data they contribute. It will be necessary to convert the `experience` and `gender` variables to a categorial type rather than `<chr>`."
